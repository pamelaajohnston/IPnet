# IPnet

This is a neural network designed to learn Intra/Inter frame types from a bespoke dataset.

`createIntraInterDataset.py` takes a bunch of encoded/decoded YUV files and turns them into a patched dataset (labelled with inter/intra depending on yuv file name - patches are labelled according to frame type rather than macroblock type, it's one of the noted limitations)
`encodeYUV.py` for encoding YUV with different compression parameters. Uses x264.
`functions.py` a library of useful functions, mostly for handling YUV colour space, resizing, saving YUV files etc
`ipNet...` the actual TensorFlow neural net stuff, based on CIFAR-10 multi-gpu tutorial.
`showBitstreamInfo.py` reads and visualises a bunch of files that are generated by a modified JM decoder.
`yuvview.py` a library of functions associated with viewing YUV.
